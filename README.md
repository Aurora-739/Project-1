Brenda's Books is an informative site design targeted to customers of the bookshop and users of the site to come and find information such as how to contact the bookshop, the history of the bookshop, the location of the store, popular books, recent donations, opening and closing times, and social media links.

## Features 

- Logo
  * Featured at the top of all pages, the logo shows the name of the bookstore / the website (Brenda's Books).
  *  On the pages Available, Bookshelf, and Newsletter clicking on the logo acts the same as clicking on the Home link in the nav bar and so sends the user to the home page.
  * The logo is in the font Fredericka the Great (a serif font) in regular 400. It is the colour #BB6464 (the hex code for the red on the page).
  * It is clear to show the user the name of the website and the bookstore to make it memorable and readable.

- Navigation & Header
  * Featured nearly at the top of the page (only below the logo) it displays all the pages / the links to the pages accessible for the user to quickly find and use.
  * The navigation links are: Home, Available, Bookshelf, and Newsletter, which link to separate pages. As well as Opening Times and Contact Us which link to parts of the Home page.
  * The navigation shows the user clearly the names of the sections and pages and makes them easy to find.
  * The navigation bar is clearly separated using two lines (above and below) to demonstrate that it is in a separate section from the rest of the page.
  * The Title / logo are not displayed within the header and are instead displayed separately above for aesthetic CSS purposes to allow the navigation to be across the width of the page while the logo stays centred at the top.
  * When you are on the page, the navigation displays the page as active by showing that name as italic, therefore showing clearly the page.
  * The colour is the red (#BB6464) which contrasts the cream background (#F3EEE5).
  * The font is Cormorant Garamond, a serif font.

- Our Story Section
  * The Our Story section is the first section on the home page. It has some text explaining the history, the vibe of the store, and examples of events.
  * This section pulls the user in and helps to create the homely and warm aesthetic that is evident in the bookshop.
  * This section also includes a video that can be interacted with to play, pause, skip. The video is of a member of staff wrapping up books.
  * This section is visually separated from the rest of the page by its layout, with the video on the right and the text on the left, spanning the whole page on medium and large screens. On smaller screens the video acts to create a visual difference between the Our Story section and the Opening/Closing Times table.
  * The text is in the same font as the navigation (the font is Cormorant Garamond, a serif font) to create a sense of fluidity and wholesomeness in the page.
  * The text colour is a warm brown (#766161) which is the same as most of the non-navigation text for the rest of the pages. This is easy to see and again contrasts nicely with the cream colour of the background (#F3EEE5).

- Opening / Closing Times Table
  * This table sits in the middle of the home page and dislays a list of opening and closing times for the week.
  * The table has visible lines to distinguish the cells from each other and bold text for each of the days.
  * The text at the headers of each cell is red (#BB6464) and slightly larger than the rest of the text in the table to show the user the importance.
  * When hovered over, the text in the cells changes from the usual brown (#766161) to the red (#BB6464) so that the user can see clearly where they are in the table.
  * The text is in the same font as the navigation (the font is Cormorant Garamond, a serif font) to create a sense of fluidity and wholesomeness in the page.
  * There is also a link in the navigation that sends the user to this section of the home page regardless of what page they are currently on.

- Our Location
  * The Our Location section serves the purpose of giving the user more information about the bookstore. The website is for a place, and so a location and a map of where this place is are crucial for users of the site to be able to find the bookstore.
  * The Our Location section is easy to find at the bottom of the Home webpage.
  * The Our Location section has a large image of a map with a pin for the location of the bookstore.
  * Above all of this content is an h2 title of "Our Location" which is in the regular brown (#766161).
  * Alongside the map is also a written-out address with an address h3 title in brown (#766161). The address contains a link that when clicked on, goes to a separate page with the address in Google maps. (This is also in the brown colour, but when hovered over on larger screens, it fades to red and is underlined to demonstrate it as a link).

- Contact Us
  * The Contact Us section of the web page is on the Home page and is set on large screens parallel with the Our Location section and on smaller screens is set below it.
  * The contact section has a snappy title, engaging the users and encouraging them to contact the bookstore.
  * The contact section contains the phone number and an email address (along with icons to visually appeal to the user and to make it easier to find).
  * The contact section's title is an h3 and in the brown (#766161).
  * The contact section's text is the same colour as most of the text on the website to further the fluidity of the page.
  * There is also a link in the navigation that sends the user to this section of the home page regardless of what page they are currently on.
  * The font is Cormorant Garamond, a serif font.

- Social Media Links ~ Footer
  * The footer of all the pages has 3 icons with a link each attached to them. The first icon is for Instagram, the next for Twitter, and the last for Facebook.
  *  The links are all the red colour (#BB6464) to be consistent with the rest of the website.
  *  To visually separate the footer from the rest of the website, there is a line attached to its top.
  *   The icons are equally separated and centred on all screen sizes.
  *    The font is Cormorant Garamond, a serif font.

- Available Page
  * The Available page can be accessed from the navigation at the top of all pages.
  *  The use of the available page is to demonstrate what kind of books the shop sells to entice the user to visit the store.
  * The available page includes an h2 in the brown (#766161) describing that this page is a list of some of the best sellers.
  * The page has a book title (with an icon in the red #BB6464), an image of the book, and a brief description/blurb.
  * The book titles are also links that, when hovered over, change to the red colour (#BB6464) and go underlined, and when clicked on, send the user to a separate page with more information on the book/author.
  * The same as the other pages, the available page contains a logo at the top and the navigation just underneath, as well as the footer with social media links at the bottom.
  * The font is Cormorant Garamond, a serif font.

- Bookshelf
  * The Bookshelf page can be accessed for the navigation at the top of all the pages.
  * The Bookshelf has two "shelves" or sections, the first being "This month's donations" and the second being "staff favourites." The donation's title is an h2 and is the brown (#766161)
  * The first section (or this month's donations) contains a brief reason for why this section is here (books are donated by patrons of the store, once more furthering the connotations of the store being a small, warm place for people), a list of the books donated, each with a link that when clicked takes them to more information on a separate page about that book (when hovered, it transforms into red (#BB6464) and becomes underlined), an icon (red #BB6464) and an image (parallel or below the text depending on screen size). (text on the left, image on the right on large screens)
  * The second section (or staff favourites) contains a brief reason for why this section is here (the staff want to share their books with the customers, once more creating a wholesome atmosphere that is desired), a list of the staff and their favourite books, each with a link that when clicked takes them to more information on a separate page about that book (when hovered over, it transforms into red (#BB6464) and becomes underlined), an icon (red #BB6464) and an image (parallel or below the text depending on screen size). (text on the right, image on the left on large screens).
  * The same as the other pages, the Bookshelf page contains a logo at the top and the navigation just underneath, as well as the footer with social media links at the bottom. The font is Cormorant Garamond, a serif font.

## Testing 

- I tested that all pages work in separate browsers: Chrome, Microsoft Edge, and Firefox.
- I have confirmed that this project is responsive and works on all standard screen sizes (adjusting where necessary) and have tested in devtools device bar.
- I confirmed that all sections and pages (Home, Our Story, Opening times, Our Location, Contact Us, Available, Bookshelf and Newsletter) are readable, accessible, and easy to understand.

### Bugs Solved Bugs 
- I discovered after I deployed my GitHub pages that the Our Story section video wouldn't change size on the correct screen size, and so I had to edit the media queries and add an extra one in to be able to see the video on larger screen sizes.
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/588112fb-0007-4081-a745-cd9b4bf62c16)
- Adding an extra media query for XL screens fixed this issue.
  
- Another bug I had was that the footer on the available page wouldn't stay stuck to the bottom and instead would float above the content and below the title of the page.
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f50ca581-b4fe-460a-9064-9a6beda65e44)
- I fixed this by discovering I had missed a closing tag on the <section> for that page. Therefore, by adding this, the footer stopped being above the content.
