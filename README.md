- Our Story Section
  * The Our Story section is the first section on the home page. It has some text explaining the history, the vibe of the store and examples of events.
  * This section pulls the user in and helps to create the homely and warm aesthetic that is evident in the bookshop.
  * This section also includes a video that can be interacted with to play, pause, skip. The video is of a member of staff wrapping up books.
  * This section is visually seperated from the rest of the page by its layout with the video on the right and the text on the left spanning the whole page on medium and large screens. On smaller screens the video acts to create a visual difference between the Our Story section and the Opening/Closing Times table.
  * The text is in the same font as the naviation (The font is Cormorant Garamond, a serif font) to create a sense of fluidity and wholesomeness in the page.
  * The text colour is a warm brown (#766161) which is the same as most of the non-navigation text for the rest of the pages. This is easy to see adn again contrasts nicely with the cream colour of the background (#F3EEE5).

  * The table has visibale lines to distinguish the cells from eachother and bold text for each of the days.
  * The text at the headers of each cell is red (#BB6464) and slightly larger than the rest of the text in the table to show the user the importance.
  * When hovered over the text in the cells changes from the usual brown (#766161) to the red (#BB6464) so that the user can see clearly where they are in the table.

- Our Location
  * The Our Location section serves the purpose of giving the user more information about the bookstore. The website is for a place and so a loction and a map of where this place is is crucial for users of the site to be able to find the bookstore.
  * The Our Location section is easy to find at the bottom of the Home webpage.
  * The Our Location section has a large image of a map with a pin for the location of the bookstore.
  * Above all of this content is an h2 title of "Our Location" which is in the regular brown (#766161).
  * Alongside the map is also a written out address with an address h3 title in brown (#766161). The address contains a link that when clicked on goes to a seperate page with the address in Google maps. (This is also in the brown colour but when hovered over on larger screens fades to a red and underline to demostrate it as a link).
